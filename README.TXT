CSC 530 Assignment One

Was a little out of my element in terms of writing something on my own
so just used the aha github repo to compare the optimized code to
the unoptimized. Most interesting case that I read about was how
casting to a bool in game vendor compilers had a needless
branch instruction, so even some primitive inbuilt operations
are not fully optimized.
